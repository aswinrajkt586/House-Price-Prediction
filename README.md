#House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and more. The aim is to use a machine learning model to predict house prices accurately using data from a dataset containing information on house sales.

The project includes steps for data exploration, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Dataset
The dataset consists of 4,600 records with the following features:

date: Date of the sale
price: Sale price of the house (target variable)
bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the house
bathrooms: Number of bathrooms
sqft_living: Square footage of living space
sqft_lot: Square footage of the lot
floors: Number of floors
waterfront: Indicates if the property is waterfront (1) or not (0)
view: Rating of the house's view (0-4)
condition: Condition of the house (1-5)
sqft_above: Square footage of the house above the basement
sqft_basement: Square footage of the basement
yr_built: Year the house was built
yr_renovated: Year the house was renovated



Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
To install the necessary libraries, use the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd house-price-prediction
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To train the linear regression model and evaluate its performance, run the house_price_prediction.py script:

python house_price_prediction.py
The script will:

Load and preprocess the dataset
Train the Linear Regression model
Evaluate the model's performance on test data
Output metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R²

 
Model Evaluation
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values.
R² score: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable (house prices).
Results
The linear regression model achieved the following results:

MSE:  111408.9
R² score: 47.8
Future Work
Potential improvements for the project:

Implementing advanced regression models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
Feature engineering to enhance model performance.
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model configuration.
